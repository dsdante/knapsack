## Knapsack problem

The [knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) is to find the set of `items` with the maximum sum below `limit`.

The goal is to modify the naive solution to make it solve the problem with N=30 in a minimum time.

Input file format:  
`double limit`  
`double item[1]`  
`double item[2]`  
`...`  
`double item[N]`
